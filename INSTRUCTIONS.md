## Breakout
   Use left and right arrow keys to move paddle left and right. Move the paddle to bounce the ball off blocks until
   all blocks are cleared. There are two levels and score is based on number of broken blocks times the multiplier 
   associated with the blocks colour. Yellow blocks are 1 point, green 2, orange 5 and red 7.

## Minesweeper
   Click on cells on the board to reveal all the spaces without mines. Use the numbers to deduce the locations of the mines/
   spaces to avoid. The game is won when all spaces not containing mines are revealed or lost when the player reveals a mine. 
   Scores are the time it takes to finish the game, lower is better. Only the scores of winning games can be recorded.
